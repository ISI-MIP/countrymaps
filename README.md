#Country maps

This is work-in-progress code. Contact me before use.

Aims
----
- reference data for country masks as shapefile and raster, for all isimip / isipedia country-aggregation needs.
- produce SVG figures along with bounds for country maps plot on ISIPEDIA
- transform netCDF data into isipedia-compatible csv grids
- more ?


Content
-------
Work in progress code with jupyter notebook, that will hopefully converge towards production code.
At this stage better to ask before use.


Note git-lfs
------------
I use git-lfs for jupyter notebooks, figures etc... make sure it is installed on your computer if you use git as command line and need access to these files.
